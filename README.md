This repository contains Python code for a sleep detection system utilizing the DLib library. Notably, the crucial shape predictor .dat file required for accurate landmark detection is missing. However, users can download it separately from the official DLib website or train it using custom datasets. Once the .dat file is acquired, this project provides robust functionality for detecting sleep patterns, facilitating applications like sleep monitoring and analysis.
